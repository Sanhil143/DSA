// 198. House Robber

// You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, 
// the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically 
// contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

// Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can 
// rob tonight without alerting the police.



// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
// Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
// Output: 12
// Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
// Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

let nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
// Output: 4
let dp = new Array(nums).fill(0);
const func = (nums) => {
      let n = nums.length;
      dp[1] = nums[0];

      for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i - 1] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1])
            //two options , one either rob the current house and include all prev loot till i-2 house 
            // as can't rob i-1 in that case,
            //or
            //don't rob the current house and include all prev loot till robbing of house i-1
      }
      return dp[n];
