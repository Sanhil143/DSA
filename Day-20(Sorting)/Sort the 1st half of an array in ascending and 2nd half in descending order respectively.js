// Sort the 1st half of an array in ascending and 2nd half in descending order respectively


// Given an array of N integers, sort the first half of the array in ascending order and second half 
// in descending order.

// Note: If N is odd. then the first half will have one element less than the second half.

 

// Input: 9
//  5 2 4 7 9 3 1 6 8
//  where: First line represents the number of elements in the array.
// Second line represents the elements in the array.
 
// Output: 1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6 5

// Explanation: As we can see the array is sorted in ascending order till halfway, here till index 3 
// (till element 4). After that from index 4(from element 9), the array is in descending order.
